I just created my [first respository][1] on [GitHub][2]. It contains my implementation of the first 3 assignments from [Stanford CS193p: iPhone Application Development][3]. The course should probably be renamed iOS Application Development because it technically covers iPad and iPod Touch development too. I've been working through the video lectures and I'm halfway through I think.
