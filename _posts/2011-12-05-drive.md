The first time I went to see this movie it demanded and devoured my attention. Simultaneously brutal, sweet and sincere, Drive affected me in a way that few movies have, making me go back to see it again two more times. Easily the best movie of 2011.

I give it five Ryan Goslings (that's really fucking good).
